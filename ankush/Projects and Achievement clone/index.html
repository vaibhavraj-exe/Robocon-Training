                    <h2>Pyro</h2>
                    <p>It is a fully autonomous four-wheel drive that can be used to disinfect and sterilize using UV-C tubes placed at positions that ensure efficient sanitization. UV-C rays are the highest energy portion of the UV radiation spectrum and are used to disinfect the surroundings or the particular object when used in a proper range. The UV-C rays (ultraviolet -c) help to assassinate the harmful Microorganisms. This robot can be utilized in numerous places where sanitization is the prime aspect, such as hospitals, research labs, commercial complexes, and residences. The Prototype of Pyro is completed and tested. The UV-C was powered by the DC source via a DC to AC converter with an inbuilt choke. The efficiency of sanitization was around 98.5%</p>

                     <h2>Dave</h2>
                     <p>Dave, our Unmanned Ground Vehicle, is designed to be a service bot capable of autonomous navigation and carrying a payload of 10kg. This bot will primarily be used for deliveries on large campuses and workplaces where door-to-door delivery is extremely convenient. This bot will interact with users through a mobile app, where they will be able to summon and request deliveries. Additionally, recipients can use the same app to authenticate and open the secure container. We intend to integrate this service with third-party vendors and courier services to expand our community reach.</p>

                    <h2>Home automation system</h2>
                    <p>Led by Ashray Arya and completed over a period of over four months, a prototype and implementation of Smart Home Automation with Wi-Fi technology was demonstrated. The Wi-Fi technology employed was ESP (8266 or 32), and the system included both a software and a hardware interface. The integration of ESP Wi-Fi technology for controlling home appliances and sensors is manifested in the hardware interface, and an application is provided for controlling multiple users of the home with smartphones, tablets, and laptops.</p>

                <h2>Water Management System</h2>
                <p>Our team worked on a water management system project in which we used various sensors and worked with various ESP modules (TTGO module, ESP32, and ESP8266) and a raspberry pi. In order to upload the data collected by sensors to a MySQL database, we also built a website in PHP and HTML.</p>
